Character Creation
==================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

The adventure will take place around Good Mead - a small town in Icewind Dale which produces mead from honey. Rumour has it some townsfolk have been murdered there recently.

It'll be a pretty short adventure without much opportunity for personalised hooks, so create a level 5 character that has a reason to be in Good Mead and is motivated to help the people there.


Golden Rules
------------
1. Create a character that wants to be an adventurer.
2. Create a character that will be fun for the rest of the party to adventure with.
3. Pitch your character idea(s) to me early.

Ability Scores
--------------
We'll roll for stats, details TBD.

Let me know if there's something else you really want to play.

Multiclassing
-------------
Sure, but note it's probably a bad idea at level 5.

Backgrounds
-----------
Custom backgrounds are fine.

Innate Spellcasting
-------------------
Pre-TcoE if a racial ability or feat let you cast a spell once per long rest, RAW you don't count as knowing that spell and you cannot cast it with any spell slots you may have. Eg. Tiefling Infernal Legacy.

Post-TcoE this changed, allowing you to also cast the spell using any spell slots you may have. Eg. Fey Touched feat.

I would like to interpret all of these abilities in the post-TcoE way, so if you play a Tiefling you may also cast hellish rebuke using any spell slots you have.

Backstory
---------
I'll send you some Icewind Dale material for inspiration.

Alignment
---------
I don't care about alignment as long as it doesn't conflict with the golden rules.

Bonus points if you read this `hyper nerdy article <https://humanparts.medium.com/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d>`_ and tell me which colors represent your character's personality.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- I'm generally happy to reskin things, eg. use half-orc mechanics to play a human barbarian.
- All the optional stuff from TcoE is fine.
- Content from Eberron and Critical Role is in general not allowed, let me know if there's something you really want.
- Don't play something that will slow combat down, eg. micromanaging multiple units like summons.
- Don't play something that has lots of crazy random effects like rolling on d100 tables, eg. wild magic sorcerer.
